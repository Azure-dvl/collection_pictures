# 🖼️ Picture's Collections

Welcome to my personal wallpaper graveyard — a growing collection of images I've stumbled upon and fallen in love with. From breathtaking anime landscapes to quirky tech shots, this repo has a little bit of everything. Feel free to browse, download, and use any wallpaper that catches your eye!  

## 📂 What's inside?

- **Anime** – Zero Two, Gojo, Violet Evergarden, Ghibli landscapes, solo leveling, and a bunch of random cute/girls/guys.  
- **Arcane** – Jinx, Vi, and all the gritty Piltover vibes.  
- **Banners** – Weird, funny, and sometimes questionable banners for profiles or just for fun.  
- **Cat** – Because cats make everything better.  
- **Other** – Random stuff: calamardo, penguins, spiderman, and more.  
- **Profile** – Cropped and ready-to-use profile pictures (anime, mood, etc.).  
- **Technology** – Distro art, VS Code, skeletons, and code aesthetics.

## 🚀 How to use

1. Clone the repo or download individual images.
2. Set as wallpaper, profile pic, or just stare at them.
3. Share with friends if you want — but credits aren't necessary, just enjoy!

## 📌 Note

All images are collected from various sources across the internet. I don't own most of them — they belong to their respective artists. If you're an artist and want your work removed, just let me know.
